# Deep Fake Detection

This repository contains an AI/ML-based solution for detecting face-swap-based deep fake videos. Leveraging cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, this project aims to ensure the authenticity of digital media by accurately identifying manipulated content.

## Features

- **Face-Swap Detection**: Identifies deep fake videos with high accuracy.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Includes models trained on large datasets for effective detection.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing systems or workflows.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for setup, usage, and contribution.

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-fake-detection.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd deep-fake-detection
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Dataset**: Ensure your dataset is structured according to the guidelines in the documentation.
2. **Train the Model**: Use the provided scripts to train the model or load a pre-trained model.
3. **Run Detection**: Apply the model to detect deep fakes in your video files.

Example command to run detection:

```bash
python detect.py --input video.mp4 --model pretrained_model.h5
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please fork this repository, create a new branch for your feature or bug fix, and submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the contribution guidelines provided in the documentation.
